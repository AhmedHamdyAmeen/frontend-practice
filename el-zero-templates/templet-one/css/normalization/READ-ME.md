### **What is `normalize.css`?**

`normalize.css` is a small CSS file created to make browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It "normalizes" the differences in default styling provided by different browsers, ensuring a more uniform appearance across various platforms.

### **Key Features of `normalize.css`**
1. **Cross-Browser Consistency**:
    - It provides consistent styles for HTML elements, such as headings, forms, buttons, tables, and more.

2. **Preservation of Useful Defaults**:
    - Unlike CSS resets, `normalize.css` doesn't remove all styles but preserves useful browser defaults (e.g., link underline, bold text for headings).

3. **Fixes for Browser Bugs**:
    - It addresses quirks and bugs in older browsers (e.g., margin issues in certain browsers).

4. **Improves Accessibility**:
    - Enhances usability and accessibility by adding better default styles for certain elements (e.g., making `<abbr>` tags look better).

5. **Foundation for Custom Styles**:
    - Acts as a good starting point for your custom CSS, reducing the need to write extra boilerplate styles.

### **Why and When Should You Use `normalize.css`?**

1. **When Building Cross-Browser Websites**:
    - If you want a consistent base across multiple browsers, `normalize.css` is a must.

2. **When Using a CSS Framework**:
    - Many CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap) use `normalize.css` internally or something similar. If you aren't using a framework, adding `normalize.css` ensures a consistent base for your custom styles.

3. **When You Want to Avoid a Full CSS Reset**:
    - A CSS reset removes all browser styles, requiring you to define everything manually. `normalize.css` is more balanced and less invasive.

### **Benefits of `normalize.css`**
1. **Saves Time**:
    - You don't have to manually fix cross-browser issues.
2. **Better Usability**:
    - Improved styles for form elements, typography, and layout across different browsers.
3. **Customizable**:
    - You can modify it to suit your project needs.
4. **Lightweight**:
    - It’s small and won’t bloat your project.

### **Comparison with CSS Reset**
| Feature              | Normalize.css                     | CSS Reset                       |

| **Size**             | Smaller and more efficient        | Can be large and intrusive      |
| **Use Case**         | Best for modern projects          | Good for custom-designed projects needing complete control |
| **Cross-Browser**    | Handles quirks in modern browsers | Focuses less on fixing quirks   |

#### With `normalize.css`:
- These elements look consistent across browsers.
